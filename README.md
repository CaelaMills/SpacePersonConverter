## Introduction

SpacePersonConverter is a utility that allows users to convert English strings to Space Person strings, apply Caesar cipher encryption, calculate SHA-256 hashes, and perform a brute force attack on Caesar cipher encryption.

## Features

- English to Space Person conversion using custom symbols ($, #, !).
- Calculation of SHA-256 hash for Space Person strings.
- Caesar cipher encryption with a 5-character shift.
- Brute force attack on Caesar cipher for all 0-25 shifts.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/SpacePersonConverter.git
   or cd SpacePersonConverter then javac SpacePersonConverter.java then java SpacePersonConverter

2. **When using a VM:**
   Follow the Prompts -
   Enter an English string when prompted.
   View the Space Person conversion, SHA-256 hash, Caesar cipher, and brute force results.

## Dependencies
The program has no external dependencies. It uses standard Java libraries for string manipulation, hashing, and input handling.
